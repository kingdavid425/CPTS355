{-Haskell is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Here's the download page: http://www.haskell.org/platform/.
We will be using the HUnit unit testing package in CptS 355.  

Example of using the HUnit unit test framework.  See  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HUnit for additional documentation.
To run the tests type "runTestTT tests" at the Haskell prompt.  -}

{- Two useful functions in the HUnit package are assertEqual and assertBool.
The arguments to 'assertEqual' are:
      a descriptive string
      the expected value
      the value being tested
The arguments to 'assertBool' are:
      a descriptive string
      the boolean value being tested
